# Meteor---Highcharts-Reactive-Chart-Demo
A Meteor application that uses database values to update a reactive bar graph

<p>Most of the online demonstrations connecting the Meteor framework with data visualization tools do not illustrate how to create a chart that is *reactive*, in which the appearance of the charts live-updates as values in the database change. This Demo does exactly that. 
</p>
<p>This project uses a simple database with imported JSON values on initialization. The chart is a basic bar chart; the type of chart can be adjusted easily in the JavaScript. </p>
<p>I have found Highcharts.js to be by far the easiest data visualization tool to integrate with Meteor. Highcharts can be added to a Meteor project here:
